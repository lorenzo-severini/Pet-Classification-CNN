# Pet-Classification-CNN
The goal of this project is to implement a neural network that classifies images of 37 breeds of cats and dogs from the Oxford-IIIT-Pet dataset. The project is divided into two tasks: first, it will be asked to implement from scratch an own neural network for image classification; then is asked to fine-tune a pre-trained network provided by Keras.
